<h1>GitHub Lifetime Activity Report</h1>

<div class="meta">
    <strong>Subject:</strong> Pranshu Chourasia (anshc022)<br>
    <strong>Role:</strong> AI/ML Engineer | Full-Stack Developer | IEEE Researcher<br>
    <strong>Date:</strong> February 12, 2026
</div>

<h2>1. Executive Summary</h2>
<p>Pranshu Chourasia is a high-output contributor specializing in the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Scalable Web Systems. His GitHub footprint reveals a transition from academic research and student innovation (2022-2024) to enterprise-grade agentic workflows and decentralized protocols (2025-2026).</p>
<p><strong>Assessment:</strong> High Intensity. Pranshu has maintained a consistent development velocity over the last 3 years, with a notable surge in complexity during late 2024 and throughout 2025. He rarely just "forks" code; 91% of his repositories are original work, indicating a creator mindset rather than just a consumer.</p>

<h2>3. Major Achievements</h2>
<p>Pranshu's profile distinguishes itself through nationally recognized accolades, not just commit counts.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>SIH 2024 National Winner:</strong> Smart India Hackathon winner, validating his ability to ship under extreme pressure.</li>
    <li><strong>$5,500 IEEE EPICS Grant:</strong> Awarded for research-backed engineering excellence.</li>
    <li><strong>Entrepreneurial Success:</strong> Founder of <em>GrafikGalore.live</em>, generating ₹45,900 revenue in just 3 months.</li>
    <li><strong>Research Output:</strong> 2 IEEE Publications and significant contributions to biosensors and smart home AI.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Technical Arsenal</h2>
<p>His work distribution shows a clear evolution from pure scripting to complex application architecture.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Python (High Usage):</strong> The backbone of his AI/ML projects (TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV).</li>
    <li><strong>TypeScript/JavaScript (High Usage):</strong> Extensive use in recent full-stack applications (Next.js, React).</li>
    <li><strong>Emerging Stack (2025-2026):</strong> Recent repositories show a heavy shift toward Agentic AI and Web3/Blockchain protocols.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Project Spotlight</h2>
<h3>Current Focus: Agentic Economies (2026)</h3>
<p><strong>agent-guild-protocol (Feb 2026):</strong> A sophisticated project described as the "first autonomous freelance marketplace for AI Agents." Built with TypeScript and Smart Contracts (Base). This marks a shift from building tools to building economies.</p>

<h3>Past Hits (2023-2025)</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>TrackMine:</strong> Enterprise workflow management.</li>
    <li><strong>AarogyaAI:</strong> Healthcare/Wellness AI solutions.</li>
    <li><strong>auto-git / auto-push:</strong> DevOps automation tools.</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Activity Trends & Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>2022-2023 (The Foundation):</strong> Heavy focus on learning, small scripts, and hackathon projects.<br>
<strong>2024 (The Breakout):</strong> The "Year of Winning" (SIH 2024, Grants). Commit volume peaked with competitive coding.<br>
<strong>2025-2026 (The Architect):</strong> Fewer "toy" apps, more large-scale systems. The commit frequency is slightly lower, but the commit size and complexity are likely much higher.</p>

<h2>7. Conclusion</h2>
<p>Pranshu is not just "working"; he is compounding. He has successfully graduated from a student developer building distinct projects to a Systems Engineer building interconnected platforms. His 2026 trajectory suggests he is currently building a startup or a major platform in the AI Agent space.</p>
<p><strong>Rating:</strong> Top 5% of Student/Early-Career Developers by Output & Impact.</p>
