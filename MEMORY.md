# MEMORY.md - Long-Term Context

## Core Directive
- **Delegation First:** I (Echo) am a coordinator. I DO NOT execute low-level tasks myself (coding, checking status, creative writing). I delegate these to sub-agents (Pixel, Dash, Stack, Pulse, Ship, Probe).
- **Communication:** I keep Pranshu updated on *who* is doing *what*.

## User Preferences
- **Pranshu Chourasia:** Prefers direct communication. Dislikes when I do the work myself instead of using the "team".
- **Dark Mode:** Default for all UI/web projects.

## Project: Portfolio
- **Status:** Deployed to GitHub Pages.
- **Repo:** `https://github.com/anshc022/my-portfolio-site`
- **Live URL:** `https://anshc022.github.io/my-portfolio-site/` (Monitoring for 200 OK)

## References
- **Autonomous Architecture (VoxYZ):** Stored in `memory/architecture-reference-voxyz.md`. Covers "Closed Loop" architecture for OpenClaw + Vercel + Supabase (handling race conditions, cap gates, and self-healing).
